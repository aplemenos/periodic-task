# periodic-task
A simple microservice which returns the matching timestamps of a periodic task. A periodic task is described by the following properties:
* Period (every hour, every day, ...)
* Invocation point (where inside the period should be invoked)
* Timezone (days/months/years are timezone-depended)

## Project Structure by feature
The periodic-task project follows a common layout for Go application projects.
### cmd
This contains the entry point (main.go) files for all the services.
### pkg
Library code that's ok to use by external applications. This directory stores the `pkg/periodic-task` that contains the service, the business logic of the application, and the handler, the endpoints of service.  In addition to this, it includes the `pkg/period`, that is the process for calculating the matching timestamps of a periodic task through different time intervals, e.g. 1 hour, 1 day, 1 month, and 1 year. It is designed to utilise the strategy pattern to be extensible and easy to support new periods of decoupling the details from the service.
### internal
This package holds the private library code used in your service and stores the http server and middlewares.
### vendor
This directory stores all the third-party dependencies locally so that the version doesnâ€™t mismatch late

## Building the application
Build the periodic-task application as follows:
```
go build -v ./...
```

### Docker
You can build the Docker image (latest):
```
docker build .
```

## Running the application
Start the application on default port 8181 (or whatever the `PORT` variable is set to).
```
go run cmd/periodic-task/main.go
```

### Docker
You can also run the application using Docker providing different address and port, for example:
```
docker run --name periodic-task -p 9000:9000 -e SERVER_ADDR=0.0.0.0:9000 periodic-task-api
```

You can also build and run the application defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file with a single command:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
The configuration file supports a healthcheck that could be used to ping and verify the liveness of a DB repository.

## Test the application
To run the unit tests for the periodic-task microservice, execute the following command:
```
go test -v ./...
```
